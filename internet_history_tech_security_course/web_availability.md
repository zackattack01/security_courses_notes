# CERN High energy physics
- The internet was the infrastructure, the web gives the user interface and URLS
- The web was invented at CERN by Tim Berners-Lee and Robert Cailliau
- CERN developed browsers and servers, with the goal of worldwide hyperlinked docs

## Robert Calliau
- Allowing hyperlinked documents took away the need to know exactly what server you would need to conect to, made the internet useful for any users
- 1994- the year of the web, Mosaic got off the ground

## SLAC Stanford Linear Accelerator
- First web server
- database of 300,000 research papers
- Dr. Paul Kuntz, December 12, 1991
- Tim Berners-Lee gave a talk where he queried the CERN database, this generated a lot of interest for the web

## 1993: Gopher is dominant
- IETF internet engineering task force meeting, People were much more interested in gopher despite tim berners-lee's efforts
- for many years primary web server and browsers were built as NeXT applications
- web started growing in academia in 1993, and in everything in 1994
- Mosaic was the first consumer web browser
- NCSA created the httpd web server which is the basic for the Apache Web Server
- Many programmers formed Netscape and made fortunes, NCSA released their browser for free and focused on building standards to keep the web open
- Joseph Hardin—U of Michigan—of NCSA worked on collaboritive tools for making people to share in real time, provided support across platforms
- By late 93 there is a full suite of Mosaics, available across all platforms
