# HCI (Human Computer Interaction)
- The study of how people interact with technology
- From the human perspectiveâ€” we want to look at cognitive interactions and processes
- Users can be of any age, and can be an individual or group of users
- Tasks can be anything from logging in to analyzing a large dataset
- Context is also important, is a user doing this from an office or battlefield or hospital
- Level of difficulty of a system should be evaluated according to these terms, since users may find ways around security measures or do something insecure if the task required of them is too difficult or taxing

# Usability
- 5 main factors to be considered:
  - Speed
    - how quickly can the task be accomplished
    - iOS thumbprint identifier vs pin login
  - Efficiency
    - how many mistakes are made in accomplishing the task
    - typing at 60 wpm vs 120wpm, you'll make more mistakes at 120
    - This would be how often thumbprint isn't identified correctly
  -Learnability
    - How easy it is for a user to learn to use the system
  - Memorability
    - Extends learnability.  Once learned, how difficult is it for someone to remember if they stop using it for a period of time.
  - User Preference
    - What do users like.  Ideally users would prefer the system that measures the best on the points above, but there could be a system that does well above but that users dont like
- How can you measure these
  - Speed: timing
  - Efficiency: counting errors
  - Learnability: not straightforward, you could look at how quickly a given action takes someone a constant amount of time (indicating it has been learned)
    - This would be considered the 'learning curve'
  - Memorability: similar to learnability, you could look at user's actions after a period of not using the system and the times associated with getting a task done
  - User preference: usually done with questionnaires, surveys, or interviews 

# Task and Task Analysis
- Goals that users set out to accomplish in a system
- May require some subtasks in a system
- Measuring the usability of a given task relies on measuring of the five factors above
- Common errors:
  - Task too leading or too descriptive, just think about the goal the user has in mind
  - Specific questions.  While someone might end up doing the specific task, it is meaningless on its own and probably wasn't the intention of the user coming to the site
  - Directing users towards something that you want to tell them (not something that they actually wanted to know)
    - It should be something that the general/typical/average user will actually want to do

# Chunking Information
#### Working Memory
- 7 + or - 2 pieces of information can typically be held in memory
- If you can group things into meaningful chunks, you can remember 7 + or - 2 chunks, rather than small bits of information
  - remembering 'oomgydliev' is harder than 'video gym lo' which is harder than 'i love my dog', but they're all the same ten letters
- Create a password with meaningful chunks (eg. dates separated by a # and some initials in between), this was remembered 76% of the time as opposed to 50% for a 7 character password
  - 08#11#14Lg06#02#96kt is made up of two dates, one separator, and two sets of initials

# Mental Models
- People rely on these to apply past experience to your software
- Ways to make use of these models for you user include things like adding labels, adhering to conventions, and various affordances 

#### Affordances
- Things within a system that show a user how it's supposed to be used
- Mapping
  - Showing which knob on a stove controls which burner
  - Clear correspondance between the controls and the result of using each one (think car steeling wheel- turns left and the car turns left) 
- Visibility
  - How to accomplish a given task is clearly visible (think google search bar)
  - Colors, depth, opacity, etc portrays a message. (think seeing a greyed out option or disabled button)
- Constraints
  - How a system can prevent us from doing things that we shouldn't, encourage actions that we should take
  - Physical constraints (think plug not fitting into a socket)
  - Disabling a submit button until the form is filled with an input of appropriate length
  - We know that red means stop, double bars mean pause, sideways triangle means play

# Readings

## Usability 101
- 5 quality components, same as 5 factors above except
  - Efficiency is said to be a measure of how quickly can a user perform a task once the design is learned
  - Speed is (kind of) worked into efficiency here
  - Errors measure takes over the non speed aspects of what the above efficiency measure did
  - user preference is listed as satisfaction

#### Utility
- Another quality attribute that compliments usability
- whether or not the product accomplishes the task that the user desires/expects
- Something is useful if it has utility AND usability

#### Why usability is important
- Because if people can't find what they want to do they can't do it and they'll leave your site

#### Ways to make it better
- User testing
  - Find representative users and watch them complete representative tasks

#### When to make it better
- All the time, use multiple and frequent iterations
- Test the one before and decide what was good (what to keep) and what was bad (what to drop)
- Test every step of the way, using user testing and observing actual users, what you do isn't typical of what most people will do on your site
