# Evalutation

### Cognitive walkthrough
- Come up with 
  - description or prototype of the interface
  - description of the task
  - list of actions to complete the task
  - an idea of the user's background

- Example: gesture based authentication system
  - starts with a paper prototype
  - during the walkthough you should be focusing on questions like:
    - will user's know what controls to use to get what they want?
    - will they know what the controls do?
    - will they understand the feedback?

### Heuristic Analysis
- Walkthrough following rules of thumb or suggestions that are typical of good design
- these can be done by experts or designers
- they are typicallly done quickly and don't require much effort
- Disadvantage is that they might miss some problems that an average user would catch

###### Nielson's Heuristics
- simple and natural dialog
- speaking the user's language
- minimize the memory load on the user
- consistency
  - ie keeping login screen options in areas consistent with what users would typically encounter in mobile devices
- useful feedback
- clearly marked exits
  - providing a way for users to start over if they decide not to carry out a given action (setting a gesture in this example)
- shortcuts
- preventing errors
- good error messages should they occur
- providing help and documentation

### Personas in Evaluation
- fictitious user used as a reference point for analysis 
- has a goal or set of goals that they want to accomplish
- useful for keeping the designer from designing too much with only themselves as the user in mind
- example: Frank
  - undergrad psych major is a savvy computer user but not an expert
  - political activist that worries about his communications being monitored
  - goal is to have an easy to use login (since he's constantly connected) that's encrypted
- You would walk through the steps that Frank would take to get what he needs out of the program
- Does the design fit his needs and meet his goals?

## Takeaways
- Qualitative evaluation can provide insights into the usability of the system without real measurements or timing
- The complexity can vary, but different types of analysis have different benefits
