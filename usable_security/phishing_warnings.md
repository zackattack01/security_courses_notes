# Phishing Warnings
- Web browsers are typically able to detect a phishing site
- Despite warnings, many users will continue through to a phishing site and give up their data

### Youâ€™ve Been Warned: An Empirical Study of the Effectiveness of Web Browser Phishing Warnings
- Tested IE active and passive phishing warnings as well as Firefox's and a control group with no warnings at all
- Users were sent an email that gave them a link to the phishing site
- Most users click the link, IE passive warning was no more statistically effective than having no warning at all
- IE active warning cut down the victims to 45% (from about 90%)

###### Mental Models
- attention switch and maintainance (do users notice and focus on the warnings)
- comprehension/memory (do they know what it means and what they are supposed to do)
- attitude/beliefs (do they believe the warnings)
- motivation (do they feel that they should heed the warnings/take the recommended actions)
- behavior (do they actually do it)
- environmental stimuli (how do the warnings interact with the other elements of the page or other stimuli)

###### Conclusions
- interface is extremely important
  - better interfaces mean more secure behavior
- active warnings capture user attention and focus (and this is correlated with the target behavior)
- people are winners
  - some would continue to close the browser and then go back to the email and try again, assuming that there was something wrong with the browser when it came to that site, so why not try again (8 times)
- important to think about what you can automate and what absolutely needs to be left up to the human
