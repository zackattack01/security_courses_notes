#### Takeaways
- User interface greatly effects whether or not users understand what is being asked of them, and this effects whether or not the users will respond
- Just moving the option to ignore the warning to a more hidden place on the popup makes it less likely for the user to choose to ignore the warning
- Users are more likely to heed the warning when they are going through to a banking or commerce site where there is more likely to be a transaction of their sensitive data
- At the end of the day, even some users that read and understand the warning navigated through to the site
- Pilot studies for the paper showed that users had seen the warning message before, and just wante to move on
- Users often misattribute their security to their OS, "nothing bad will happen to my mac"
- If you think about the user's workflow and try to fit it in to that, making your desired actions for them more natural and less of a hastle, users will be less likely to try to work around the system
