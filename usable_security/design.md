# Design
- Take your design to users early and often.
- The longer you wait the further a problem could go and the more work you'll put into it.  you'll be less willing to change an aspect later on.

### Design Methodologies
#### the Design Process
- There are many:
  - iterative design
  - system centered design
  - user centered design
  - participatory design
  - designer centered design

###### Iterative Design
- Come up with a list of requirements that need to be met
- Go make the design
- Develop the design
- Test the design

###### System Centered Design
- asks questions like:
  - what can be built easily on this platform?
  - what can be created from the tools available to me?
  - what do I find interesting to work on?

###### User Centered Design
- focuses on the user's context, needs, tasks they want to accomplish
- takes into account the user's abilities and needs, and bases the design on this

###### Participatory Design
- Uses a pool of end users that participate on the development of a design along the way
- Takes advantage of the fact that users may have a completely different perspective on any given part of a design
- There should be a give and take between the designer and the participating user
