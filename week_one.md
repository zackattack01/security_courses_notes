# Intro

-Bletchley park- 10,000 people in a codebreaking effort
-Comms needed to be wireless, this needed to be encrypted

-BOMBE was a mechanical computer, used rotating pieces to brute force check 
a number of possible combinations
-Colossus was the electronic computer that did what BOMBE couldn't keep up with

# Bletchley park:

- Bletchley park just north of london
- Allister Deniston drew up a list of people to come to Bletchley
- Winston Churchill okayed the increase in resources to Bletchley
- Similar to today's NSA
- Poles developed technique that isolated the message header used by the Germans, they used the Bomba, which the bombe was based on
- Diagonal board reduced the number of wasted or random stops
- Between 10-12 miles of wire
- First Colossus had 2500 valves
  - paper tapes run at 30 mph
  - each valve has hot wire heater in the middle
  - Machine was left on, never shut down to reduce the risk of thermal shock
  - No memory, all results of the algorithm were held in a store
- Turing left bletchley after 3.5 years, wasn't really involved in Colossus
- Welchman went to the US, taught the first csci classes at MIT
- Turing commited suicide in 1954

# Computing with phone lines

- A series of computers came up post-war
- Electronic computation became a large focus in academia
- Boom in support for math/sciences as it was seen as having won the war

- John Forbes Nash
  - phd in Math at Princeton in 1950 at 22 years old
  - Economics guy
  - Had severe adult onset schizophrenia

- Phone line networking
  - Leased lines: very expensive, comp to comp, slow (used by banks to transfer data once a day)
  - Dial up access: you could call other computers. characters were encoded as sound. common in the 1970's

# Michigan Terminal System

- Dial number to connect
- You must sign on using your system identification, and password, which is validated by the system
