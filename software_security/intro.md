# Intro to Software Security

## Aims
- Should prevent unwanted behaviors like
  - stealing information, or a lack of confidentiality
  - corrupting information or functionality, or a lack of integrity
  - stopping resources from being made available to customers, or a lack of availability
- Should protect against defects, or vulnerabilities
- Should identify and repair bugs or design flaws, before they can be exploited

## Key Terms
- White-box approach: focuses on the code itself, or internals of the program
- Black-box approach: largely ignores the internals of the program and looks at it from the outside as a whole
