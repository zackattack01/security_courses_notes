# History through Supercomputing

### Data transfers with leased lines

- you could pay to rent a dedicated connection between phones
- this was expensive, but no dialing would be needed because there would always be a connection
- dial up connections from local computers to one base host, and then the direct connection to another base would be along a leased line
- anytime there was an outage your data could be stuck on a disk drives or in a queue until it was ready

### Packet Switching

- Started with research from ARPANET
- Every message is broken into many pieces
- Each packet is addressed with from, to, and order that it should be reassembled in
- Packets are all thrown into gateway, and these find a way to get data to their destination gateway

- Breakthroughs from the NCSA national center for supercomputing applications

- Larry Smarr
  - Astronomy and weather were primary uses for supercomputers at the time
  - Larry said that these could be used for solving the most difficult problems in physics
  - Found out after the sputnik program, there was a drop in supercomputer development and usage in the academic sector (became primarily a private sector concept)
  - Raised awareness of the academic possibilities for use of supercomputers
  - telecom lobbyist turned down person to person connections, saying it was private sector

### History of NSFNet

- funded by the national science foundation
- Merit was one fo the first networks designed for a community of students
  - U of Michigan didn't get a supercomputer center
- Proposal teamed up with IBM and others to propose what was essentially a 55 million dollar project for 15 million in funding
- Eventually federal funding was cut
